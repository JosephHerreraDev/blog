Many aspiring developers fear the unknown future that lies ahead. It's undeniable that the release of ChatGPT has altered the developer workflow, but this change benefits those who truly understand the essence of being a software developer.

These past days have been particularly intriguing. Nvidia director Jen-Hsun Huang recently suggested that developers might not be needed in the near future, as apps could be built using natural language. Similarly, Devin from Cognition has presented itself as "the first AI software engineer." While these advancements sound impressive, their true impact remains to be seen, especially since they still require guidance from actual engineers.

Feeling overwhelmed by these developments is natural. It might seem like your career is on shaky ground, leading to a drop in self-confidence.

## Mental state

First and foremost, strive to achieve a mental state where you view these technologies as tools that enhance your abilities (when used responsibly). Software development is an inherently creative skill, where you transform ideas into tangible products by communicating with computers. Even if the process eventually involves merely instructing the AI on how to build an app, it still necessitates someone with the right skills to translate client requirements into functional, secure, and innovative features.

## Skills

To become a better software developer, the most crucial step is to code more. Make coding enjoyable by turning it into a hobby that allows you to level up and build a community.

When coding becomes tedious, break it down into smaller tasks. You don't have to build an entire application in a single day. Engage in micro-projects, programming challenges, and larger projects, but avoid trying to accomplish everything at once.

Reignite your passion for coding by working on projects that you love. If work or school has dampened your enthusiasm, explore different domains, such as game development, to keep things fresh and exciting.

There are many more tips and tricks to improve your skills, like those shared by BigBoxSWE on his YouTube channel. However, the most important thing you can do is open your IDE and start creating. Embrace change, remain resilient, and remember that the only thing you can control is how you respond to these advancements.
